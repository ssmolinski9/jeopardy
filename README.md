## Jeopardy

The minimalist implementation of Jeopardy! game clone, written for a party with friends :).
It's just fun project, but feel free to contribute, bc I know code could be better.

Categories and questions are in `data.txt` file. First line is reserved for points thresholds â€” number of thresholds = number of questions in each category. Next lines are in format: \
``Category name ; First question ; Second question ...``
and so on.
